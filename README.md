Starbase
===========

An HTML game in the style of an incremental game (like [Candy Box](http://candybox2.net/), [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), or [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/)) mixed with [Tiny Tower](http://nimblebit.com/)!

This will probably be open source later. Definitely feel free to look around and learn from the code!

Note
---------
You must build the files yourselves by using Grunt. 

If you don't know what that is or how to do it, [check out this amazing article](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/) that got me up and running in 20 minutes!
